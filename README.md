# Teaching a Computer to Diagnose Cancer: An Introduction to Machine Learning

This presentation provides an introduction to machine learning. We begin with an explanation of important machine learning concepts and then develop a program to diagnose breast cancer with 95% accuracy.

## Getting Started

Start by reading the [presentation](https://github.com/glennrfisher/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/presentation/presentation.pdf). Then check out the [notebook](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/glennrfisher/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/notebook/Teaching%20a%20Computer%20to%20Diagnose%20Cancer.html) with the program to diagnose cancer cells.

## Running the Program

You can view the program to diagnose cancer cells as [HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/glennrfisher/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/notebook/Teaching%20a%20Computer%20to%20Diagnose%20Cancer.html) or [an interactive notebook document](https://github.com/glennrfisher/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/notebook/Teaching%20a%20Computer%20to%20Diagnose%20Cancer.ipynb).

To execute the interactive notebook document on your computer:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/).
2. Install dependencies: `conda install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
3. Download the [interactive notebook document](https://github.com/glennrfisher/introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/master/notebook/Teaching%20a%20Computer%20to%20Diagnose%20Cancer.ipynb).
4. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5. In the browser window that launches, navigate to and open the interactive notebook document.
6. Press `Shift-Enter` to execute a cell.
